# telemetry_tools

This repository contains code used to work with telemetry data from the FOXSI-4 mission flight. It is composed of code that was employed for data handling and not for data display. This code might serve other purposes outside of the [GSE](https://github.com/foxsi/GSE-FOXSI-4) code as it contains raw data parsers and Python classes for data filtering.
